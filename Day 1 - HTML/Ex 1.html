		<h2>I like to go swimming in the summer</h2>
		<p1>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining </p1>
		<br>
		<p2>and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an</p2>
		<br>
		<p3>impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.</p3>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2>There are three reasons I like to swim:</p2>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
			<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
			<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
		</ul>
